## PSD cosine law matrix
This is a small code for testing the sufficient conditions for obtaining a positive semi-definite matrix **M** with components

**M**<sub>ij</sub> = (*h*(i, 0)<sub>2<\sub> + *h*(j, 0)<sub>2<\sub>  - *h*(i, j)<sub>2<\sub> )/2, where *h* is a specific non-negative symmetric function with defined properties.

## Description
`working_points.ipynb`: jupyter notebook to demonstrate that the theory works for two sets of points with point coordinated constructed from a contingency dataset and using their representations in Correspondence Analysis.

`rand_points.ipynb`: jupyter notebook to demonstrate that the theory works on randomly generated points (at least it works for the few trials done with our computers)

`rand_points_chgdist.ipynb`: same as `rand_points.ipynb` but the distance within set was multiplied by a positive constant

## Theory
Mathematical statements and proofs are provided in our paper (comming soon)
