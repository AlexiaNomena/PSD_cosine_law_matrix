## PSD cosine law matrix
This is a small code for testing the construction of a positive semi-definite matrix whose elements is defined as 

`M_{ij} = (h(i, 0)^2 + h(j, 0)^2 - h(i, j)^2)/2`, where `h` is a specific non-negative symmetric function with defined properties.

## Description
`working_example.ipynb`: jupyter notebook to demonstrate that the theory works for two set of points with point coordinated constructed from a contingency dataset and using their representations by Correspondence Analysis.

`random_example.ipynb`: jupyter notebook to demonstrate that the theory works on randomly generated points (at least it works for the few trials done with our computers)

## Theory
